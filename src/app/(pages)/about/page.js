                        This club is an initiative to bring together students interested
                        in coding and associated skills in a peer-to-peer learning
                        environment. We believe that a peer-to-peer learning environment
                        is the best way to hone our skills and achieve our goals. Each
                        member of the club brings their own unique vision and perspective,
                        and we encourage everyone to share their ideas and experiences.
                        Whether you&#39;re a seasoned developer or just starting out, we
                        welcome you to join us and be a part of our community. The club is
                        open to all students. The only prerequisite to join us is
                        enthusiasm for coding and development, or at least curiosity
                        towards it.
